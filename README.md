Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This project predicts customer churn using demographic and service-related data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that helps companies predict which customers are likely to churn and proactively implement retention strategies. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take preventive actions to retain valuable users.

Folder Structure
The project follows a modular folder structure for better organization and scalability:

data/: Contains both the raw and processed data.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model experimentation.
src/: Python scripts for different tasks like data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
models/: Stores the trained models and evaluation report files.
reports/: Final project report and key findings are stored here.
Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure to have Python 3.7+ installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

Clone the repository:
python -m venv venv



pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the necessary libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains demographic and service-related features of customers, along with a Churn column indicating whether a customer has churned. Place your dataset in the data/ folder for easy access.

How to Run
Run the main.py script: The main.py file executes the entire process, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Simply run the script to execute the project:

python main.py
This will:

Load the data from the data/ folder.
Preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict churn.
Evaluate the model and print key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
Save the trained model and evaluation report to the models/ folder.
Jupyter Notebooks: If you prefer to explore the data interactively, use the Jupyter notebooks located in the notebooks/ folder. These notebooks include:

Data Exploration: Visualize and understand the features of the dataset.
Model Building: Experiment with different algorithms for churn prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of different models using various metrics.

Model Training
The machine learning model used in this project is trained on the customer data and predicts whether a customer will churn or not. The training process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and perform feature engineering.
Model Selection: Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
Model Evaluation
After training the model, it is evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
AUC (Area Under Curve): A performance measure for classification problems.
The results will be stored in the models/ folder.

Reports
The final evaluation report, including model performance and key insights from the data, will be stored in the reports/ folder. This report summarizes the findings and provides actionable insights for improving customer retention.

Conclusion
By using this churn prediction model, companies can identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them, improving customer lifetime value and reducing churn rates.

This template includes everything from project setup to running the script and exploring the notebook. You can further adjust it to fit your exact project needs and structure.
